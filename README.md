# 🚀 DSA-in-C

Welcome to **DSA-in-C** — my personal journey of learning and practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in the C language.  
This repository is structured, beginner-friendly, and continuously updated as I learn and implement more concepts.

---

## 📌 About
- 🚀 Learning **DSA from scratch** in C  
- ✍️ Covers **basics to advanced** implementations  
- 📂 Includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting, searching, trees, graphs, and more  
- 📝 Each program is written in **C language (.c files)** with clean formatting  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Algorithms Covered
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, etc.)  
- Graphs  
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap)  
- Searching (Linear, Binary, Hashing)  

---

## 📂 Current Implementations

### 🔹 Arrays
- **array_basic.c** → Basics of arrays & some fundamental operations  
- **array_insertion.c** → Demonstrates insertion operations in arrays  
- 🔜 **array_deletion.c** → (Coming soon) Array deletion examples  

### 🔹 Strings
- 🔜 **whti_string.c** → (Coming soon) Basic string operations

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository and compile any program using `gcc`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-pranjalpandey-daemon/DSA-in-C.git
cd DSA-in-C

# Example: compile array insertion
gcc arrays/array_insertion.c -o array_insertion
./array_insertion
